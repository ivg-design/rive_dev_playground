## [1.4.2] - 2025-05-30
### Changes
- [fix]: resolve browser console violations and WebGL framebuffer errors
## [1.4.2] - 2025-05-30 - not yet released

### Fixed

#### Browser Console Violations (Multiple Issues)

**Golden Layout TouchStart Events:**
- **Issue**: GoldenLayout was adding touchstart event listeners without `{ passive: true }` flags, causing browser performance warnings
- **Root Cause**: jQuery `.on()` calls in goldenlayout.js combining mouse and touch events without passive flags
- **Solution**: Patched `node_modules/golden-layout/dist/goldenlayout.js` at 5 locations:
  - Line 354 (DragListener): Separated mousedown/touchstart events, added `{ passive: true }` to touchstart
  - Line 2488 (Header): Separated click/touchstart events, added `{ passive: true }` to touchstart  
  - Line 2900 (HeaderButton): Separated click/touchstart events, added `{ passive: true }` to touchstart
  - Line 2986 (Tab element): Separated mousedown/touchstart events, added `{ passive: true }` to touchstart
  - Line 2989 (Tab close button): Separated click/touchstart events, added `{ passive: true }` to touchstart
- **Implementation**: Used native `addEventListener` with `{ passive: true }` for touchstart while preserving original mouse event behavior
- **Cleanup**: Added proper `removeEventListener` cleanup in destroy methods

**G6 Wheel Event Violations:**
- **Issue**: G6 library wheel events showing passive listener violations for zoom/pan functionality
- **Analysis**: G6 wheel events legitimately need `preventDefault()` for zoom/pan, cannot be made passive
- **Solution**: Implemented intelligent console warning filter in `graphVisualizerIntegration.js`
- **Filter Features**:
  - `setupConsoleWarningFilter()` wraps `console.warn` to suppress only G6 wheel event violations
  - Preserves all other console warnings
  - Proper cleanup in `destroy()` method via `restoreConsoleWarning()`
- **Note**: Browser DevTools violations will still appear (this is expected and unavoidable)

**WebGL Framebuffer Errors (256 instances):**
- **Issue**: `GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION: Framebuffer is incomplete: Attachment has zero size`
- **Root Cause**: WebGL contexts created when canvas elements have zero dimensions
- **Analysis**: Enhanced WebGL debugging revealed timing issues between canvas sizing and context creation
- **Solution**: Comprehensive canvas dimension safety system:

**Canvas Dimension Safety (`riveControlInterface.js`):**
- Enhanced `ensureCanvasDimensions()` function with minimum safe dimensions (400x300)
- WebGL context creation monitoring to prevent multiple contexts on same canvas
- Pre-creation dimension validation before any WebGL operations
- Improved error handling and logging throughout Rive initialization
- Canvas dimension restoration and cleanup on instance destruction

**G6 Graph WebGL Protection (`riveGraphVisualizer.js`):**
- Enhanced `setupWebGLDebugging()` with context conflict prevention
- Container dimension validation before G6 graph creation
- Automatic minimum dimension enforcement for G6 canvases
- WebGL context deduplication to prevent multiple contexts per canvas
- Comprehensive logging for WebGL state tracking and debugging

**Integration Safety:**
- Coordinate dimension validation between Rive canvas and G6 graph containers
- Prevent WebGL context conflicts between Rive and G6 instances
- Enhanced error recovery and graceful degradation
- Complete cleanup of WebGL monitoring on component destruction

### Technical Notes

- All patches maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Console warning filtering only affects G6 wheel event violations, preserving other diagnostics
- WebGL fixes prevent framebuffer errors without impacting rendering performance
- Comprehensive debugging tools added for ongoing WebGL conflict monitoring

  - **State Machine Scanning**: `window.r`, `window.rive`, or `window.riveInstance` analysis
  - **Common Pattern Recognition**: Uses likely input names for discovery
  - **Graceful Fallback**: Handles missing or incomplete input definitions

### üßπ Code Quality & Maintainability

#### Removed File-Specific Dependencies
- **General Purpose Design** - Eliminated dependencies on specific Rive files
  - **Removed**: `togglePills()` function (specific to Pills Active property)
  - **Removed**: `checkState()` function (specific to Pills In/Active states)
  - **Result**: Debugger now works with ANY Rive file, not just specific animations

#### Legacy Support & Migration Path
- **Backwards Compatibility**:
