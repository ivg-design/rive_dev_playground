# Rive Tester Project Rules

## Core Principles
1. Always consult @Rive Runtime documentation for implementation decisions
2. Maintain dual logging (browser console + terminal) for all tests
3. Proceed autonomously with testing and iteration
4. Launch terminal processes as needed for testing

## Project Structure
- `/animations` - Store Rive animation files (.riv)
- `/tests` - Test suites and utilities
- `/logs` - Test output and logs

## Testing Guidelines
1. Every test must output to both:
   - Browser console (for visual debugging)
   - Terminal (for automated testing)
2. Tests should be self-documenting
3. Use WebSocket for real-time browser-terminal communication

## Development Workflow
1. Write tests in test.js
2. Run tests with `npm test`
3. Watch mode available with `npm run dev`
4. All changes must maintain dual logging capability

## Error Handling
1. All errors must be caught and logged to both outputs
2. Use appropriate error levels (info, debug, error)
3. Include stack traces in terminal output

## Performance Considerations
1. Monitor animation loading times
2. Track memory usage
3. Log performance metrics to both outputs

## Documentation
1. Keep README.md updated
2. Document all test cases
3. Include setup instructions
4. Maintain changelog
